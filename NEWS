NEW in 2.3.0 (since 2.2.0)
--------------------------

* Packetogram plugin to display packet size distribution


NEW in 2.2.0 (since 2.1.0)
--------------------------

* Faster deadlock detection

* Can replay pcap in a loop

* Can now pass nettrack values to a guile action

* More doc (in doc/)

* Support for multiline HTTP headers

* Guile files are pre-compiled before installation (see ./configure --help)


New in 2.1.0 (since 2.0.0)
--------------------------

* New simpler syntax for packet filters

* Primitive implementation of `nettrack`, a network event tracking language
  above packet filters

* Custom memory allocator that performs marginally better on large networks

* OS detection based on TCP, ripped with shame from p0f
  (http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/p0f3/)

* Plugins are now loaded from system library directory (usualy
  /usr/local/lib/junkie) if not found.

* Junkie can now forward traffic information to another junkie:

  junkie -p serializer.so -i eth0 &
  junkie -e '(open-deserializer)' -p some_plugin

* Compiled packet filters (much faster than tshark filters):

  junkie -i eth0 -p writer.so --file=/dev/stdout --method=csv \
    --netmatch '((tcp with (dst-port = 80)) (http with ((set? host) && (host =s "www.google.com"))))'


New in 1.4.0 (since 1.3.0)
--------------------------

* Basic HTTP server (for those unhappy with the parentheses)
  Activate at your own risk!

* Writer plugin can now be scripted from guile

* Packet deduplication is now done per vlan and/or per ifaces
  (unless these are collapsed of course)

* You can use the same loging facility from guile than from C

* A way to send parsed infos to another program via socket

* When replaying a pcap file, can now patch timestamp with current time


New in 1.3.0 (since 1.2.0)
--------------------------

* Use guile-2

* Reopen network interfaces after they go down/up


New in 1.2.0 (since 1.1.0)
--------------------------

* Finer grained locks

* NBNS / LLMNR / MDNS name resolution protocols


New in 1.1.0 (since 1.0.0)
--------------------------

* Support for IP fragmentation, TCP reordering and stream reassembly

* Parsers for (some version of) PostgreSQL, MySQL and Oracle

* HTTP parser is now statefull
