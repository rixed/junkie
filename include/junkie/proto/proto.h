/** @file
 * @brief Packet inspection
 *
 * Each packet received from libpcap is passed to a toplevel "capture" parser,
 * which then builds a small struct proto_info describing the packet and
 * handling the payload to a child parser. This child parser performs in a
 * similar fashion, extracting from the received data the interesting bits,
 * building another struct proto_info describing this parser and handling the
 * payload to yet another parser, etc... Eventually the whole packet will be
 * inspected, with various content involving several protocols one or several
 * times.  Each time a proto_info is construct for a given protocol, callbacks
 * registered for this proto are called with the list of all the proto_infos
 * from packet root up to this proto layer.
 *
 * Parsers are designed in order to be (as most as possible) independent on
 * each others. Their aim is to extract from the packet only the informations
 * regarding the protocol they implement (ie. the information that are easy to
 * extract in realtime but presumed meaningful for a large set of callbacks).
 *
 * Having independent parsers implies that every parser is committed to a given
 * behavior. For instance, every protocol parser must have a single parse
 * function receiving the relevant data from its parent and its parent's
 * proto_info (which can be used to inspect upper layers). This common behavior
 * is inherited from the struct proto that defines the behavior of all parsers
 * of this proto.
 *
 * We have several constraints/wishes to take into account :
 *
 * - we want to store all gathered informations on the stack so that we don't
 * have to handle memory allocation for these transient data structures;
 *
 * - we want a parser to be able to call several sub-parsers on the same data
 * if its unsure which parser should handle a payload;
 *
 * - for robustness we would like junkie to keep working if for some reason a
 * parser is unable to operate (lack some resource).
 *
 * How can a parser call a sub-parser if they do not know each other? For
 * instance, how can IP call UDP parser? Either IP has to know UDP and call it
 * directly for proper protocol field, or UDP has to know that there is that IP
 * parser which dispatch its payload according to a protocol field, and register
 * for the protocol 17. This later alternative, although more complex, was
 * chosen because it is more general and also make it possible to configure any
 * other mapping in runtime (for instance, ask for HTTP parsing on TCP port
 * 8080 as well as 80).
 *
 * Either way, the struct proto describing a parser has to be public so that a
 * parser can spawn a new parser for this protocol. But that's the only link
 * that exists between two parsers, and apart from the case where a parser look
 * something into one of its parent's proto_info then one can safely modify a
 * parser implementation without interfering with any other parsers.
 *
 * Regarding callbacks, please bear in mind that many are called for every
 * packet.  Even a given one can be called several times for the same packet.
 * This is contrary to the rule that was prevailing with previous versions of
 * junkie (prior to version 2.0), and makes pcap writing/injecting more
 * complex.  The benefit is to allow more in depth analyses to free the upper
 * protocol layers from the bounds of individual packets.

/** Multiplexers are the most complicated parsers.
 *
 * A parser is called a \e multiplexer if it has several children of various
 * types (ie. of various struct proto) and pass some payload to them according
 * to a given key. For instance, IP is a multiplexer that use the ip addresses
 * and protocol field as a key to choose amongst its children which is
 * responsible for the payload. Similarly, TCP is a multiplexer using the
 * ports pair to choose amongst its children the one in charge for a payload.
 *
 * Multiplexers can not be stateless, since each instance of a multiplexer must
 * carry a list of its children; for performance reason actually not a list
 * but a hash. But many multiplexers share a common behavior : from the header
 * of their data, build a key that identifies a children, then lookup in the
 * children list (hash) the one in charge for this key, or create a new one if
 * none is found.
 *
 * struct mux_proto/mux_parser implement this common behavior, given a small
 * set of parameters :
 *
 * - the size of the key;
 *
 * - the max number of children allowed per multiplexer instance.
 *
 * The hash function being generic, only the key size matters and not the
 * actual structure of the key (as long as your key is packed_).
 *
 * But yet there is an important difficulty to grasp : some stateful parsers
 * deeper in the tree may need to handle traffic in both direction in order to
 * parse the payload (for instance, it need the query to parse the answer, or
 * just want to repeat the query in the proto_info of the answer for
 * simplicity). This mean, for instance, that the same TCP parser that handles
 * the TCP payload from ipA to ipB also handles the payload from ipB to ipA
 * (and so on). In this very example it implies that the IP parser must use the
 * same key for (TCP, ipA, ipB) than for (TCP, ipB, ipA). This is easily done
 * for instance if the IP key is build with sorted IP addresses, for instance
 * storing always smallest IP first (this is actually what's done).
 *
 * But this TCP parser itself must pass its payload from ipA:portA->ipB:portB
 * to the same child than the one receiving payload from ipB:portB->ipA:portA.
 * This is where things get more complicated, since TCP cannot merely sort
 * the ports when building its key. If we were doing this, the same child would
 * also receive traffic from ipA:portB->ipB:portA, which would be a bug.
 * In fact, to build its key the TCP parser must know how the IP key was build
 * and respect the same order. In other word, the rule is : once the top level
 * multiplexer (here, IP) have chosen a way to store its bidirectional key then
 * all multiplexers deepest in the tree must build their keys accordingly.
 *
 * That's the purpose of the "way" parameter of the parse() function : once set
 * by the toplevel multiplexer, other multiplexers must use it to build their key
 * (and pass it to their children).
 *
 * Although quite abstract for the average C coder, once understood these
 * helpers allows to add other multiplexers very quickly and provides as a free
 * bonus SNMP statistics for all multiplexers (such as average collision rate
 * in the hash) and guile extensions available for tuning any multiplexers.
